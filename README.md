# LSX-FAQ Extension
Looking to display a beautifully adaptive FAQ's pageo your LSX Theme run website? LSX FAQ's extends the functionality of the LSX theme by adding an additional post type to your Wordpress site. 

The "FAQ" post type is where all questions your users are frequently asking you can be stored easily. Once these have been stored your documentation page will be automatically created and the FAQs stored will display in Javascript orientatd dropdowns for your users experience.
